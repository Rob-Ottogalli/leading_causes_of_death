# Proposal
Analyze data for leading causes of death in the US from 2013-2015 to evaluate following hypothesis.


Our project will analyze mortality in America from 2013 to 2015, specifically with regards to: 
* Seasonal impact on mortality.
* Women's education impact on child mortality.
* Impact of college education on mortality.
* Impact of marital status, gender and cardiovascular mortality.

## Hypothesis
* Many causes of death have a clear seasonal pattern.
* As education level increases in women child mortality tends to reduce.

* As education level increases, cancer and heart disease mortality rates will decrease
* An additional year of college decreases mortality rates by 15 to 19 percent by reducing deaths from cancer and heart disease.
* Someone who completed High School, but did not attend college will be higher than those of those who attended some college/bachlors/masters/doctorate. 

* The risk of cardiovascular mortality is greater in single, never married men and separated/divorced women compared with those that are married.

By analyzing this topic: our app will identify trends that public health officials will be able to use to optimize future spending to improve public health outcomes the scenarios.
