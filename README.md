# Proposal
To determine the leading causes of death in the US from 2013-2015

Our project will analyze mortality in America from 2013 to 2015, specifically with regards to: 
* Seasonal impact on mortality, 
* Women's education impact on child mortality, 
* Impact of college education on mortality, and 
* Impact of marital status, gender and cardiovascular mortality.

By analyzing this topic: our app will identify trends that public health officials will be able to use to optimize future spending to improve public health outcomes.
